## Liskov Substitution Principle

The Liskov Substitution principle states that:

> If you have a program that works with a certain type of object, 
> you should be able to use any subtype of that object without any problems.

It means that all methods and properties in the main class should also
work for all the subclasses without needing to change anything.
