## Interface Segregation Principle

The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is a rule for making computer 
programs that states:

> When we make different parts of a program, we shouldn't make them all
> the same way. Instead, we should make them smaller and more specific, so
> that other parts of the program don't have to depend on things they 
> don't need.

This makes it easy to creates code that's easy to maintain since each part
only does what it needs to.
