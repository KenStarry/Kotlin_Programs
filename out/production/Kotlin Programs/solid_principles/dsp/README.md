## Dependency Inversion Principle

The Dependency Inversion Principle (DSP) states:

> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, 
> but both should depend on abstractions.

This means that classes should depend on abstractions, not on concrete 
implementations. 

The idea behind DIP is to decouple components from each other, 
which makes the code more modular, easier to test, and more maintainable.
