## Open-Closed Principle

The Open/Closed Principle is a rule in OOP that says:

> Classes, modules, functions and other software entities should be open
> for extension but closed for modification.

It means that you can add new things to a class without changing its 
original code.

So, instead of changing the class itself, you can write new code that uses
the existing class to add new features.
